# Resume Enhancer Agent

## Purpose
This agent is designed to optimize a user's resume for a specific job application. It analyzes the target job description and suggests or directly applies modifications to the resume content to improve its compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and overall relevance to the job requirements.

## Dependencies
- `logging`: Standard Python library for logging.
- `typing`: For type hints.

## Key Components
- `resume_enhancer_agent.py`:
  - Defines the `ResumeEnhancerAgent` class, which contains the `enhance_resume` method.
  - The `enhance_resume` method takes `resume_data` (the user's structured resume information) and a `job_description` string as input.
  - It currently includes placeholder logic to demonstrate how skills mentioned in the job description but not present in the resume could be suggested or added.
  - In a more advanced implementation, this method would leverage natural language processing (NLP) to:
    - Extract key phrases, skills, and requirements from the job description.
    - Compare them against the resume content.
    - Rephrase bullet points, add relevant keywords, and highlight experiences that directly align with the job.
    - Potentially generate an optimized version of the resume or provide actionable suggestions.

## Usage Examples
```python
from packages.agents.resume_enhancer.resume_enhancer_agent import ResumeEnhancerAgent
from packages.utilities.logging_utils import setup_logging

# Setup logging for better output
setup_logging()

# Initialize the ResumeEnhancerAgent
enhancer = ResumeEnhancerAgent()

# Dummy resume data
dummy_resume_data = {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "skills": ["Python", "SQL", "Project Management"],
    "experience": [
        {"title": "Software Developer", "description": "Developed web applications."}
    ]
}

# Dummy job description
dummy_job_description = (
    "We are seeking a skilled Software Engineer with expertise in Python, SQL, and Cloud Computing. "
    "Experience with large-scale data science projects is a plus. "
    "Candidate should be proficient in developing robust and scalable solutions."
)

print("\n--- Original Resume Data ---")
print(dummy_resume_data)

print("\n--- Enhancing Resume ---")
enhanced_resume = enhancer.enhance_resume(dummy_resume_data, dummy_job_description)

print("\n--- Enhanced Resume Data ---")
print(enhanced_resume)

# Another example with different skills
dummy_job_description_2 = (
    "Looking for a Data Scientist with strong Machine Learning skills. "
    "Familiarity with Python and statistical modeling is required."
)

print("\n--- Enhancing Resume (Second Example) ---")
enhanced_resume_2 = enhancer.enhance_resume(dummy_resume_data, dummy_job_description_2)

print("\n--- Enhanced Resume Data (Second Example) ---")
print(enhanced_resume_2)
```

## API Reference

### `ResumeEnhancerAgent` Class
- `__init__(self)`: Initializes the agent and its logger.
- `enhance_resume(self, resume_data: Dict[str, Any], job_description: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`:
  - `resume_data`: A dictionary representing the user's structured resume data.
  - `job_description`: A string containing the full text of the job description.
  - Returns a dictionary representing the enhanced resume data, optimized for the given job description.

## Development Setup
No special setup is required beyond standard Python environment setup. Ensure all dependencies are installed.

## Testing
To test the `ResumeEnhancerAgent`, run `resume_enhancer_agent.py` directly. It contains an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block with example usage.

## Contributing
Follow the general contribution guidelines for the project. When enhancing the resume optimization logic, consider integrating more sophisticated NLP techniques, keyword density analysis, and potentially external data sources for industry-specific terminology.
