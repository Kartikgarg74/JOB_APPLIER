# Embedding Generator

## Purpose
This module is responsible for generating numerical embeddings (vector representations) for textual data, such as resume content, job descriptions, or skill sets. These embeddings are crucial for enabling semantic search and similarity matching, allowing the application to understand the contextual meaning of text rather than just keyword presence.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations, particularly for simulating embedding vectors.
- `sentence-transformers` (commented out): The intended primary dependency for loading pre-trained transformer models like Sentence-BERT to generate high-quality embeddings.

## Key Components
### `EmbeddingGenerator` Class
This class provides methods to generate embeddings for single texts or batches of texts.

- **`__init__(self, model_name: str = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")`**
  - Initializes the `EmbeddingGenerator`. It takes `model_name` as an argument, which specifies the pre-trained model to be loaded (e.g., a Sentence-BERT model).
  - **Note**: The actual model loading (`SentenceTransformer(model_name)`) is currently commented out and replaced with a placeholder for simulation purposes. In a production environment, this would load the specified model.

- **`generate_embedding(self, text: str) -> List[float]`**
  - Generates a single embedding vector for the given input `text`.
  - **Note**: Currently, this method simulates a 384-dimensional embedding using `numpy.random.rand`. When the `sentence-transformers` model is integrated, it will return the actual embedding from the model.

- **`generate_embeddings_batch(self, texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]`**
  - Generates embedding vectors for a list of input `texts`.
  - **Note**: Similar to `generate_embedding`, this method currently simulates batch embeddings. It will use the actual model for batch processing upon full integration.

## Workflow
1. **Initialization**: Create an instance of `EmbeddingGenerator`, optionally specifying a different pre-trained model name.
2. **Text Input**: Provide text (or a list of texts) that needs to be converted into numerical embeddings.
3. **Embedding Generation**: Call `generate_embedding()` for single texts or `generate_embeddings_batch()` for multiple texts.
4. **Output**: Receive a list of floats (or a list of lists of floats for batch) representing the numerical embedding(s).

## Usage Examples

```python
from packages.utilities.vector_matching.embedding_generator import EmbeddingGenerator

# Initialize the embedding generator
# In a real scenario, ensure 'sentence-transformers' is installed and the model is downloaded
embedding_gen = EmbeddingGenerator()

# Example 1: Generate embedding for a single text
resume_text = "Experienced software engineer with strong Python and machine learning skills."
resume_embedding = embedding_gen.generate_embedding(resume_text)
print(f"Resume Embedding (first 5 elements): {resume_embedding[:5]}...")
print(f"Resume Embedding Dimension: {len(resume_embedding)}")

# Example 2: Generate embeddings for a batch of texts
job_descriptions = [
    "Seeking a Python developer with expertise in web frameworks and databases.",
    "Data scientist role focused on statistical modeling and data visualization.",
    "Junior software engineer position, fresh graduates welcome."
]
job_embeddings = embedding_gen.generate_embeddings_batch(job_descriptions)

print(f"\nGenerated {len(job_embeddings)} job embeddings.")
for i, emb in enumerate(job_embeddings):
    print(f"Job {i+1} Embedding (first 5 elements): {emb[:5]}...")
    print(f"Job {i+1} Embedding Dimension: {len(emb)}")
```

## Future Development
- Full integration of `sentence-transformers` library for actual embedding generation.
- Support for different embedding models and fine-tuning capabilities.
- Caching mechanisms for frequently requested embeddings.

## Testing
Testing for this module would involve:
- Verifying that the `generate_embedding` and `generate_embeddings_batch` methods return vectors of the expected dimension.
- (Once integrated) Comparing embeddings generated by the actual model against known good embeddings for specific texts to ensure correctness.
- Performance testing for batch processing efficiency.
