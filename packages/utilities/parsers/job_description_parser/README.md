# Job Description Parser

## Purpose
The Job Description Parser module is designed to extract key entities and structured information from raw job description text. This parsed data is crucial for various downstream processes, such as job matching, ATS scoring, and application automation.

## Dependencies
None explicitly defined within this module, but future implementations may depend on NLP libraries like `spaCy` or `NLTK`.

## Key Components
- `parse_job_description(text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`: A function that takes raw job description text as input and returns a dictionary containing extracted structured data.

## Current Implementation Status
This module currently contains a placeholder implementation. The `parse_job_description` function provides a basic structure for the expected output but does not yet perform advanced NLP-based extraction. It only extracts the first line as a "title" as a simple example.

## Future Development
Future enhancements to this module will include:
- Integration with advanced NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for robust entity recognition.
- Extraction of specific fields such as:
  - Job Title
  - Company Name
  - Location
  - Required Skills (technical and soft)
  - Experience Level
  - Educational Requirements
  - Responsibilities
  - Benefits
- Handling of various job description formats and structures.
- Implementation of more sophisticated parsing logic to accurately identify and categorize information.

## Usage Example
```python
from packages.utilities.parsers.job_description_parser import parse_job_description

job_desc_text = """
Software Engineer - Python
Acme Corp - San Francisco, CA

Responsibilities:
- Develop and maintain backend services
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams

Requirements:
- 3+ years of experience with Python
- Strong understanding of algorithms and data structures
"""

parsed_data = parse_job_description(job_desc_text)

print(f"Parsed Title: {parsed_data.get('title')}")
print(f"Parsed Skills (placeholder): {parsed_data.get('skills')}")
# Expected output for skills would be more comprehensive after full implementation
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome to enhance the parsing capabilities of this module. Focus areas include:
- Adding robust NLP models.
- Improving accuracy of entity extraction.
- Expanding the range of fields extracted.
- Handling diverse job description formats.
