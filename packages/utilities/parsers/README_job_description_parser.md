# Job Description Parser Utilities

## Purpose
This module, `job_description_parser.py`, is intended to provide functions for parsing raw job description text and extracting key entities and structured data. This is crucial for matching job seekers with relevant opportunities, analyzing market trends, and populating job listing databases within the Job Applier application.

## Dependencies
- Standard Python libraries.

## Key Functions
- `parse_job_description(text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`:
  - **Purpose**: Parses a given string of job description text and extracts structured information such as job title, company, location, requirements, skills, and experience level.
  - **Note**: Currently contains placeholder logic. A full implementation would typically involve Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using libraries like `spaCy`, `NLTK`, or advanced regular expressions to accurately identify and extract information.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `text` (str): The raw text content of the job description.
  - **Returns**: A dictionary containing the extracted structured data. The dictionary includes fields like `title`, `company`, `location`, `requirements`, `skills`, `experience_level`, and can be extended with more fields as needed.

## Workflow
1. Raw job description text is provided as input to the `parse_job_description` function.
2. The function processes the text to identify and extract relevant pieces of information.
3. The extracted data is then organized into a structured dictionary format.

## Usage Example
```python
from packages.utilities.parsers.job_description_parser import parse_job_description

# Example job description text
job_description_text = """

"""

# Parse the job description
parsed_data = parse_job_description(job_description_text)

# Print the extracted data
print("Parsed Job Description:")
for key, value in parsed_data.items():
    print(f"  {key}: {value}")

# Example of accessing specific fields
print(f"\nJob Title: {parsed_data.get('title')}")
print(f"Company: {parsed_data.get('company')}")
print(f"Skills: {', '.join(parsed_data.get('skills', []))}")
```

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with advanced NLP libraries (e.g., `spaCy`, `NLTK`, `Hugging Face Transformers`) for more accurate and comprehensive entity extraction.
- Implementation of machine learning models for classifying job descriptions or extracting specific attributes.
- Support for different job description formats and sources.
- More robust error handling and logging.
