# Migration: `ce9da821a1d1_add_user_profile_education_experience_.py`

## Purpose
This migration script, identified by `ce9da821a1d1`, is intended to add user profile, education, experience, projects, and job preferences models. However, upon inspection, both its `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions contain only `pass` statements, meaning it does not perform any actual database schema modifications. The tables mentioned in its message (`users`, `education`, `experience`, `projects`, `job_preferences`) were already created by the preceding migration `7817cb5869b5_add_google_id_and_image_to_user_model.py`.

## Revision Details
- **Revision ID**: `ce9da821a1d1`
- **Revises**: `7817cb5869b5` (This indicates it comes directly after the `7817cb5869b5` migration).
- **Create Date**: `2025-07-19 21:55:16.451132`

## `upgrade()` Function
- **Purpose**: To apply database schema changes.
- **Content**: Contains `pass`, indicating no operations are performed during the upgrade.

## `downgrade()` Function
- **Purpose**: To revert database schema changes.
- **Content**: Contains `pass`, indicating no operations are performed during the downgrade.

## Usage
This migration, while part of the migration history, has no functional effect on the database schema due to its empty `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions. It would be applied as part of the normal Alembic upgrade process but will not introduce or remove any tables or columns.

## Notes
- There is a discrepancy between the migration's descriptive message and its actual content. The tables it claims to add were already established in the previous migration (`7817cb5869b5`).
- This migration might be a result of an `alembic revision --autogenerate` command run when no changes were detected, or it might have been intended for future changes that were never implemented.
