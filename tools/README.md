# Tools Directory

## Purpose
This directory is designated for various development and operational tools that support the JobApplierAgent monorepo but are not part of the core application logic or shared packages. These might include:
- Custom scripts for build processes, deployment, or environment setup.
- Utility scripts for data management, testing, or code generation.
- Configuration files for external tools (e.g., linters, formatters, CI/CD).

## Dependencies
Tools in this directory may have their own specific dependencies, which should be documented within their respective subdirectories or scripts. They generally do not have direct dependencies on the core application code, though they might interact with it.

## Key Components
(This section will be populated as specific tools are added)

Examples of potential tools:
- `setup_dev_env.sh`: A shell script to automate the setup of a local development environment.
- `lint_check.py`: A Python script to run custom linting checks across the codebase.
- `deploy_script.sh`: A script for deploying the application to a staging or production environment.

## Usage Examples
Tools are typically executed directly from the command line.

```bash
# Example: Running a hypothetical setup script
./tools/setup_dev_env.sh

# Example: Running a custom linting tool
python tools/lint_check.py
```

## API Reference
(N/A - this directory primarily contains executable scripts and configurations, not a programmatic API)

## Development Setup
Specific setup instructions for each tool should be provided within its own documentation or comments.

## Testing
Tools should be tested to ensure they perform their intended function correctly and do not introduce unintended side effects.

## Contributing
Refer to the main `README.md` in the monorepo root for general contribution guidelines.
