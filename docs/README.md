# Documentation

## Purpose
This directory serves as the central repository for all high-level documentation related to the JobApplierAgent monorepo. It includes architectural overviews, design decisions, system diagrams, and other non-code documentation that provides a comprehensive understanding of the project.

## Dependencies
This directory typically contains static files (Markdown, images, diagrams) and does not have runtime dependencies on the application code. It might depend on documentation generation tools (e.g., Sphinx, MkDocs) for building a navigable documentation site.

## Key Components
(This section will be populated as specific documentation files are added)

Examples of potential documentation:
- `architecture_overview.md`: A high-level description of the system's architecture, including how different agents and modules interact.
- `design_principles.md`: Documenting the core design principles and philosophies guiding the project.
- `api_spec.md`: Detailed specifications for external APIs or internal service interfaces.
- `deployment_guide.md`: Instructions and considerations for deploying the JobApplierAgent.
- `troubleshooting.md`: Common issues and their resolutions.

## Usage Examples
Documentation files are typically read directly or rendered through a documentation generator.

```bash
# Example: To view a markdown file
cat docs/architecture_overview.md

# Example: To build a documentation site (if a generator is configured)
mkdocs build
```

## API Reference
(N/A - this directory contains documentation, not a programmatic API)

## Development Setup
No specific setup is required for this directory beyond standard text editors or markdown viewers. If a documentation generator is used, its setup instructions will be provided in the main `README.md` or within this directory.

## Testing
Documentation is typically reviewed for accuracy, clarity, and completeness rather than automated testing.

## Contributing
Refer to the main `README.md` in the monorepo root for general contribution guidelines. When contributing to documentation, ensure it is clear, concise, and up-to-date with the codebase.
